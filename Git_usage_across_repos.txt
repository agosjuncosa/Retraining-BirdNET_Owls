<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<USING THE SAME KEY ACROSS MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Once you've added your SSH public key to your GitHub (or other Git platform) account, you can use that same key to authenticate with any repository under that account.
Thereâ€™s no need to generate a new key for each repository unless you specifically want to separate them for security or organizational reasons.

Once you've added your SSH key to your account, you can clone or push/pull from any repository associated with your account by using the SSH URLs:

Clone repository 1

```
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repository1.git

```

Clone repository 2

```
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repository2.git

```

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<HOW TO USE DIFFERENT REPOSITORIES AND MOVE FILES BETWEEN THEM>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Scenario 1: Moving Files Manually
If you just want to copy or move files from one repository to another (without keeping history), you can do this manually:

Navigate to the repository where the files exist:

```
cd /path/to/repository1

```
Copy or move the files to the directory of the other repository:

To copy files (preserving the original):
```
cp /path/to/file /path/to/other/repository
```
To move files (removing the original):

```
mv /path/to/file /path/to/other/repository

```
Commit and push the changes in the second repository:

Navigate to the second repository:

```
cd /path/to/other/repository

```
Add, commit, and push the changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added files from repository1"
git push origin main

```
