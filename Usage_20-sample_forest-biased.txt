--This code is intended to be used to select a stratified subset of recordings representing
the 20% of audio data representative of the survey effort across months, night periods
and habitat types but with an intended bias to overrepresent the forest habitat type
up to a 30% more than the other habitat types. This was intended to make the model more
capable of correctly classifiying the more rare sapecies (or trying to) that are
solely present in the forest habitat type. Moreover, this habitat type is likely to 
have a more complexity and viersity of sounds than the farms and pine plantation habitat
types. 

To run this file from the console you should locate the directory where the file is stored
then run python3 stratified_selection.py /path/to/root_dir /path/to/target_dir


In the first intent using Disco 2 found FA 654 files, PI 654 files and FO 851 (biasing for 30% more).
