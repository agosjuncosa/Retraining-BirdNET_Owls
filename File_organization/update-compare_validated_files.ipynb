    "I have made a mistake while analyzing the data and I have used the wrong parameters such as sensitivity and threshold. Sensitivity used was 0.5, lower to what I should have used which causes less target predictions and also more polarized scores, lower scoring clips will have even lower scores and higher scoring clips will have even higher scores. The threshold used was of 0.1 meaning the 10% which also caused to have fewer detections and some classes were not represented at all. That is why I need to reanalyze my data using the correct parameters of sensitivity 1.0 and threshold of 0.01. But as previously I have already validated the top scoring clips and those are likely to be the same, I want to avoid revalidating clips. That is what this code does"
